            <h3><em>Pinterest Usability Study</em></h3>
            <div class = "work-text">
                <p>–– Usability study analysis on Pinterest, completed with classmates Akansha Dey, Brent Bosart, and Armand DiLisio ––</p>
                <p>For this project, our team posed the questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How do the purposes and goals of Pinterest usage vary, if at all, amongst male and female Generation Z users?</li>
                    <li>What aspects of Pinterest’s functionalities aid, hinder or are irrelevant to the goals of experienced users?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Target audience and participant demographic:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gen. Z Pinterest users that have experience using the platform, with an even spread of male and female participants.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Virtual interview through conference call (members: 1 interviewer / moderator, 2 notetakers, 1 observer, participant)</li>
                    <li>UAR (Usability Aspect Report) development using interview notes and footage</li>
                    <li>Analysis and comparison of critical points, severity of problems, and relationship of problems between UARs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Male and female usage of the Pinterest have no significant differences</li>
                    <li>Pinterest usage is predominantly for personal reasons such as hobbies, interests, and inspiration</li>
                    <li>Most Pinterest users do not engage with the social functions that are available</li>
                    <li>Further, many Pinterest users are unaware of how to use these social functions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Recommendations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Converting the "follow" feature to a "Subscription" feature, allowing users to subscribe to content creators that fit their personal needs</li>
                    <li>Toggle the social aspect of Pinterest, allowing users to turn these features off could reduce the cognitive load on their screen</li>
                    <li>Change nothing at all; the social functionalities do not aid, nor hinder, the user's goal</li>
                </ul>

            <h3><em>Creating a Clockface</em></h3>
            <div class = "work-text">
                <p>–– Laser-cut clockface created through the use of sketching and Adobe Illustrator ––</p>
                <p>This project was a class assignment, where the prompt was to create a clockface for your room that would demonstrate an understanding using a laser-cutter.  
                    I began this process by brainstorming clockfaces that would fit aesthetically in my room. I developed three clockfaces, and chose one. </p>
                <p>Next, I iterated over the sketch using Adobe Illustrator and made minor changes. I adjusted the document size, then submitted this file to the 
                    MSU MakerSpace laser cutter to create the piece.</p>
                <p>Finally, using the clock mechanism provided by our professor, I put the clock together.</p>
