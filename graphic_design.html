                <p>–– Matching design templates for a resume, letterhead, and business card using Adobe InDesign ––</p>
                <p>Through my learned knowledge of Adobe InDesign and the basic design principles, I designed a resume, 
                    letterhead, and business card that are visually appealing and represents my personal style.</p>
                <p>*This resume template was completed my second year at MSU, and is not currently updated.</p>

            <div class = "work-text">
                <p>–– Breakfast poster designed using Adobe Illustrator ––</p>
                <p>For this poster, I began by searching the web (Pinterest, Google Images) for "Western posters". Once I had an
                    understanding of the "Western" poster style, I brainstormed possible image elements in the poster (toast, bagels, eggs, milk)
                    and decided that eggs would allow me to work with the three primary colors.
                </p>
                <p>From there, I chose bold fonts, and used multiple drop shadows on the word "breakfast" to depict the "Western" style.</p>

            <h3><em>Mood Board</em></h3>
            <div class = "work-text">
                <p>–– Mood Board created using Adobe Photoshop ––</p>
                <p>My goal was to create a mood board was to create a logo, choose a color theme, choose a font-family, and use photos to depict my personal
                    style if I had a design company. I needed to convey the styles and concepts that could be used for web development, social media profiles,
                    and branding in general. 
                </p>
                <p>I began by developing a rough, image-based mood board on Pinterest to get an idea of what color scheme, aesthetic, and style I would use.
                    Using many of the photos from the Pinterest board, I developed a color palette that I used throughout the mood board. Along with this,
                    I developed a logo for my imaginary company, including a milk carton because I personally love milk and the way milk cartons look (personal branding!).
