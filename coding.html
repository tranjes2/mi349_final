                <p>–– Website development using HTML, CSS, and Javascript ––</p>
                <p>Using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, I coded a soundboard website for the Friends TV show and deployed it using Netlify.
                    This website features photos of each of the six main characters. Clicking on any of the images will play a line from the show.</p>

            <div class = "work-text">
                <p>–– Portfolio website development using HTML and CSS ––</p>
                <p>Preproduction:</p>
                <p>I began by creating a pitchboard; this consisted of a short and long elevator pitch describing my project, as well as a few personas describing
                    key users that could interact with my website. Along with this, a few comparitive portfolios were listed as inspiration and example for
                    the development of my website.</p>
                <p>Once I created the pitchboard, I developed wireframes for my website depicting the general layout of the website, pages, and more. The 
                    wireframes consisted of all copywriting, but any style was absent at this stage. After the wireframe was developed, I created compositions
                    of each page on the website. At this point, I began to include style and color in the design to portray what the final website should look
                    like. The compositions were completed in Figma.</p>
                <p>After all of the preproduction steps, I began by coding all of the HTML files necessary for my website. Once the HTML files were completed,
                    I was able to implement CSS to modify the look and style of the pages to align with my compositions. </p>

            <h3><em>Choosing a Major: Is Money on Your Mind?</em></h3>
            <div class = "work-text">
                <p>–– Data analysis using Rstudio and data from FiveThirtyEight ––</p>
                <p>Using data compiled from the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Series by FiveThirtyEight about college majors, 
                    I completed analysis in regards to the question of whether people chose majors for monetary reasons, or otherwise. 
                    I created data visualizations and carried out the analysis using Rstudio, and converted the file into an HTML markup.</p>
                <p>My process:</p>
                <p>I began by studying the background of the data, as well as the structure and characteristics of the dataset. From here, 
                    I created visualizations to look at the variation in some variables, such as the median income across different major categories.
                    This allowed me to gauge some of the patterns in the dataset, which led me to look into the relationships between variables; 
                    percentage of people in majors versus median incomes, for example.</p>
