            <p>Hi, my name is Jessica. I am an undergraduate student attending Michigan State University, 
                pursuing a degree in Media & Information with a focus on creating Human-Centered Technology. 
                As an aspiring UX designer, I have gained experience and learned about usability testing, 
                evaluation, graphic design, and a little bit of coding. </p>
            <p>I am looking to expand my portfolio and gain real-world experience with design, UX, UI, and 
                coding by applying my learned knowledge of processes and theories surrounding these concepts. </p>
